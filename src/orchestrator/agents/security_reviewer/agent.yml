  1. Action: [E.g., User opened a programming IDE and searched for a specific file.]
    - Context: Cursor hovered over the "File Explorer" before selecting `sensitive_data.docx`.
    - Reasoning: Observation suggested the user was reviewing critical files.

    - Context: Password field was briefly visible during attempted login to `secure_system.com`.
    - Reasoning: Credentials exposure could lead to unauthorized access. 

  ## Security Risk Analysis:
  - Event 1: **Risk Level:** 5 (Medium Risk) - Interaction with important data but no overt sharing or copying detected.
  - Event 2: **Risk Level:** 10 (High Risk) - Password visible on screen could lead to high-security impact.
